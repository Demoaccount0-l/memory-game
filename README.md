<h1 id="title">Memory Game</h1>

<p id="description">This project was part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. The main goal of this project was to build a memory card game using React (especially hooks and lifecycle methods). The game consists of six levels of difficulty, in which in each level, the user must click on all images exactly once. When the user clicks on an image, the cards are all randomly redistributed. If the user clicks on the same image twice, the game ends. The user can then restart the game, with their best result being saved. This project was made using React JS and CSS modules. </p>

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
